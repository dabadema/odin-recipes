        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500 g. of potatoes</li>
            <li>1 onion, preferably white</li>
            <li>150 ml. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>16 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Scrape the new potatoes or leave the skins on, if you prefer. Cut them into thick slices. Chop the onion</li>
            <li>Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a large frying pan, add the potatoes and onion and stew gently, partially covered, for 30 mins, stirring occasionally until the potatoes are softened. Strain the potatoes and onion through a colander into a large bowl (set the strained oil aside)</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs separately, then stir into the potatoes with the parsley and plenty of salt and pepper. Heat a little of the strained oil in a smaller pan</li>
            <li>Tip everything into the pan and cook on a moderate heat, using a spatula to shape the omelette into a cushion.</li>
            <li>When almost set, invert on a plate and slide back into the pan and cook a few more minutes</li>
            <li>Invert twice more, cooking the omelette briefly each time and pressing the edges to keep the cushion shape. Slide on to a plate and cool for 10 mins before serving</li>
        </ol>
